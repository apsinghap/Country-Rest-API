# Country Data API Service
This Node.js application provides a backend API service for retrieving useful data about countries using the REST Countries API. It includes endpoints for authentication, fetching detailed information about a specific country, and retrieving a list of countries based on filters and sorting.

# Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your machine.
npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
Getting Started
# Clone the repository:

git clone - repo url




## Install dependencies:



1.npm install
1.Run the application:

1.npm start
1.The server will start running on http://localhost:3000.

# Endpoints
1. Authentication
   ```request
   {
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password"
```
1. Fetch Detailed Information about a Specific Country.
2. Retrieve a List of Countries




 # Error Handling
If the authentication fails or the auth token is not present, the API returns a 401 Unauthorized error.

If the REST Countries API request fails or returns an error, the API returns a 500 Internal Server Error with a descriptive error message.
Security Considerations
In a production environment, ensure that sensitive information (e.g., credentials, tokens) is handled securely using environment variables.
Implement additional security measures such as HTTPS for secure communication.
